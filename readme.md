In a humanitarian crisis, the data generated by all the organizations involved in the relief effort is difficult to coordinate. Humanitarians will usually send excel files to a central coodinator, but there is no way of making them use a standardized structure for their files.
<br/><br/>
This tool that allows a humanitarian in the field to upload their data in a way that can be aggregated and queried. The application accepts excel files of any structure, has a user interface for annotating them, and converts them to hxl, a format for capturing unstructured semantic data.
